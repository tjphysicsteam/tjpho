# TJ Physics Olympiad

Welcome to the 2025 TJ Physics Olympiad, the largest international high school run physics examination!
The Thomas Jefferson Physics Olympiad (TJPhO) is a free annual international high school competition
that focuses on one applied physics problem every year.

Our goal is to reach aspiring physicists from all over the world and introduce them to a variety of topics,
and give them the tools to tackle all types of problems. We also hope that when working
in teams, students will gain valuable experience in collaboration and communication with others.
