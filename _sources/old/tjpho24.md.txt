# TJPhO 2024

Welcome to the 2024 TJ Physics Olympiad, the largest international high school run physics examination!
This year's contest will run from 06/07 8AM EST to 06/10 11:59PM EST.
The Thomas Jefferson Physics Olympiad (TJPhO) is a free annual international high school competition that
focuses one one applied physics problem every year.

## Topic

The theme of this year's exam is stars! There are several free response questions,
each which has multiple subsections. Each free response question focuses on a particular
topic in physics and can be approached using AP Physics knowledge. The thought process must be explained,
with calculations and diagrams if necessary, to receive credit. Partial credit is given for incomplete solutions.
Problems are weighted by difficulty: the test usually gets harder as it goes.

## Exam

Participants will be given four days to complete the TJ Physics Olympiad. It is recommended that participants
compete in teams of three, one of whom will register by filling out the form. When the competition starts,
you will receive an email with the problems to submit and a google form to submit your solutions.
While the exam is at the high school physics level, middle school students may also participate.
If your team registered, [tjhsstphysicsteam@gmail.com](mailto:tjhsstphysicsteam@gmail.com) will send you the exam. The test contains background
information as well as introductory, intermediate, and advanced problems in order to better understand the material.

Students participating in the competition may only communicate with members of their team. No other collaboration is
allowed, including mentors, teachers, professors, and other students. Teams are not allowed to use online resources
(except mathematical resources such as wolfram alpha), post content on online forums asking questions related to the
exam, or books.

Teams are welcome to email us if they have any questions about the above rules. For each question,
you must explain how you got a particular answer even if you are not specifically asked to do so.
Partial credit will be given, so even if you are not able to solve a problem fully, show us your thought process and what you've gotten so far. Lastly, the top five teams will receive awards.

## Sponsors

This year, TJPhO was sponsors by wolfram, Impact Books, and Physics with Elliot.
